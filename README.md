# Northern Lights Solar Greenhouse
Northern Lights Solar Greenhouse is a future passive solar greenhouse built in partnership with the Thompson Crisis Centre.  The greenhouse will provide a safe space for families impacted by domestic violence to learn horticultural skills.  Harvested produce will be shared within the community to support families experiencing food insecurity.
